Rcd - RemoteControl in D
========================

`Rcd` enables you a remote control for your Laptop/PC, heck for any device!
(Current limitation: needs X11)

Sitting in bed watching TV or Youtube on your PC-Screen? Film ends, what now?
Stand up, shut that machine down? Naa, too tired! Or go to the next video, different
channel? Naa, I need to stand up! Well one solution would be to bring your mouse
with you when going to bed, but what about the cable, or the distance between receiver
and mouse? Dammit! The solution `rcd`! Your phone, right next to you, right?
Open the browser you trust, navigate to the `rcd` instance and control your PC,
nothing easier than that!
Epic Win!


Installation
============

Just grab a [DUB](http://registry.vibed.org/download) executable, clone the repository

    git clone -r git://github.com/Dav1dde/rcd.git

(the `-r` flag is important)

Navigate into `rcd` (`cd rcd`), launch `dub`, done! For the lazy!

    git clone -r git://github.com/Dav1dde/rcd.git
    cd rcd
    dub build
    bin/rcd

What else?
==========

Enjoy!
